<p>Obscurity is where you can trade your goods with other people. You can also auction your goods to the highest bidder or participate in them as well. This
company was founded because many folks have alot of items around the house and wish to declutter, some folks want discounted or outdated items as collections
and others who want to make a buck on the side selling nonconventional items without shame or buy them without shame.</p>
